== Assignment

The goal is to create a part of a virtual reality system, which enhances the
experience in the virtual reality worlds with real-world effects, such as wind
or heat effects. The work is split into three parts — web-based room
configurator, server application, and Unity framework plug-in.

1. Research relevant electrical appliances and their capabilities, determine
    which of those are suitable for producing the effects and controlling
    programmatically from a computer.

2. Research and evaluate existing software solutions for the room configuration.

3. Using the typical software engineering methods, design the room configurator
    and methods of communication between devices and the server.

4. Implement the web-based room configurator, server application, and Unity
    framework plug-in.

5. Write unit tests, perform integration tests and user testing of the
    completed system.
