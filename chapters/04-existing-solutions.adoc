== Existing solutions and Related work

In this chapter, existing similar software and research papers related to this
work are discussed. While the previous chapter discussed the VR haptics in
general and presented the most popular current products and researches, this
chapter will focus more on similar projects, that implements winds simulations
or other external effects on the user. It also focuses on similar software
solutions relevant to the configuration tool planned for this work.

=== Related work

One of the research papers, called
"Wind and Warmth in Virtual Reality: Implementation and Evaluation"
showed that it's very similar to this work and chose a similar approach. Two
other projects (VRScooter and Ambiotherm) are of the similar or same topic,
but choosing different approach with different objectives.
Following text is discussing the results of the research.

==== Ambiotherm

Ambiotherm is a project researched by Nimesha Ranasinghe et al. at Keio-NUS
CUTE Center, Interactive & Digital Media Institute, National University of
Singapore. This project presents a prototype of wearable accessory for virtual
reality headsets that is attached to user's head and neck, to simulate wind
and heat sources. The control module is communicating over Bluetooth with
a mobile device running the VR simulation.

System is designed to be used with mobile VR systems.
The advantage of this system is the usage of inexpensive hardware and low power
demands. One limiting factor of this system is the lack of locality of the effects.
It is most apparent on the heat simulation, which can simulate
only ambient temperatures -- since the heat generating device is
placed on user's neck, user cannot tell where the heat is coming from.

Accessory is demonstrated on two VR environments -- hot desert and
snowy mountains. Using these environments a study is performed addressing
design factors of the system and acessory's effect on user's presence
and immersion in the virtual environment.

==== Wind and Warmth in CAVE at Bielefeld University

CAVE is a virtual reality system presented at SIGGRAPH in 1992.
It's quite popular among universities and research centers, because there are
many researches done using the CAVE system. CAVE is a bit different from
usual contemporary virtual reality systems, because it doesn't utilize
stereoscopic displays attached to user's head, but rather uses multiple
projectors to project images on all sides of the room, where the
VR experience takes the place.

In 2014, at Faculty of Technology of Bielefield University in Germany,
a group of researched called "AI Group" presented a research paper, in which
they described a system within the CAVE system, that can simulate winds
and heat in a room in various locations and directions.

Results of this system have served as a inspiration to create this work.
However, the equipment used for reproducing the system described in this work
is very expensive and not easily accessible for consumer users.
It consists of many hardware parts, powerful computers and multiple
network systems and protocols. The fans and lights used are commonly used
for various live performances, such as in theatres or live concerts, and are
also very expensive.

==== VR Scooter

In 2006 L.Deligiannidis and R. J.K. Jacob presented a novel input device called
"VR scooter". This device has vibrotactile feedback generators mounted on itself
and acompanying fans are blowing wind to simulate motion of the scooter.

Work concluded that wind simulation and vibration is a viable travel
mechanism type in VR environments. Other than that, the study conducted within
the work confirmed the hypothesis, that performance improves when the level of
immersion is increased.

==== Conclusion

It is also important to note, that almost none of the mentioned works focused on
creating accessible developer tools to help interested developers to create
content using modern tools, frameworks and game engines.

=== Configurator tools

To configure room to properly produce external effects, it needs to be
configured. System described in this work will need a configuration utility.
Software related to room configuration is evaluated, whether it's relevant
to virtual reality, IoT or none of them. It's focused on user interface and functionalities.
Results of this short research of existing solutions
will provide an input for the upcoming analysis and design.

==== SteamVR Room Setup

SteamVR is runtime software primarily designed to be used with headsets made
by Valve Corporation (HTC Vive, Valve Index, etc.). Software is used for
system configuration, status reporting, device management and provides users
with user interface in VR <<steamvr>>.

In the Room Setup configuration utility, users are guided through few steps
in which they can prepare their newly bought system to be used in their
space.

In one particular step (which can be seen on the screenshot), user can see
real-time tracking of his space and location of all tracked devices viewed
from the top on a 2-dimensional plane. Thanks to this visual cue, users can
easily set room size and configure the play-space size and rotation
as they like.

More information about the SteamVR system can be found online at

* User interface is very simple and easy to use, it's trying to be informal
  and entertaining (it's using characters from the Portal 2 game universe
  footnote:[Game universe refers to a collection of art, characters, story
  or items related to a single or series of computer games.],
  and displays various entertaining animations thoughout the process)
* Tracked devices (headset, controllers and lighthouses) are visible in
  real-time on the screen.
* All locations can be set using tracked controllers. Users can set play-space
  size by taking their controller in four corners of the room and pressing
  the trigger on the controller in each of the corners.

* The software purpose is to set just the size of play-space, therefore it's not
  meant to work
  with any other tracked devices, third-party hardware or other elements or
  other things placed in the room.
* There is no ability to see heights of the objects, as the workspace is
  on a 2-dimensional plane.

==== Oculus Rift Sensor Setup

Oculus Rift Sensor Setup is a configuration utility from Valve Corporation's
competitor -- Facebook Inc. It's intended to be used with their headsets
product line named "Oculus".

Since the Oculus Rift uses a different tracking method (using infra-red cameras),
the configuration utility is a little bit different and takes a little more
time to setup properly.

The cameras positions are displayed on the 2D-plane visualiser, similarly
to SteamVR Room Setup. The feedback of location is important, because
user, who is configuring the system, needs to know how to position the
cameras better to achieve better tracking of the headset and the controllers.

Overall, the configurator utility is very similar to SteamVR's one, though it
is less playful and configuring the system takes more time (there are more steps
involved).

* User interface is modern and more formal.
* Tracked devices (headset, controllers and cameras) are visible in real-time
  on the screen.

* For correct configuration, the configurator requires very strict placement
  of the cameras. The configuration process is known to be frustrating,
  as it sometimes can take a lot of time to position the cameras correctly.
* There is no ability to see heights of the objects, as the workspace is
  on a 2-dimensional plane.

==== xcape.io

Xcape.io is software used for automating escape rooms
footnote:[Escape room is a popular entertainment game, where players are locked
in a room, and through puzzles are challenged to escape the room in a time limit.].
Although this software's relevance might seem to be far away,
the similarity lies in the system's utilization of IoT devices
connected together to provide the automation. Users can connect various
devices and set a behaviour to them.

The software is using MQTT for communication. It can run a MQTT server and
therefore supports any device, that uses MQTT as a communication protocol.

The system can be scripted to perform variety of tasks. System is available
for free as a open-source project on GitHub.
