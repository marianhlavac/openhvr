== Example application using OpenHVR

To demonstrate the abilities of the system, an example VR application
was created.

In the application, user can walk around the virtual room and interact with
various items inside the room. Some of the items are equipped with OpenHVR
effects. Each of example effect use is described below.

This example application will be used in one of the user tests, where
participants will be asked about overall opinion on the system and its
immersiveness.

3D models and materials was created using Microsoft Maquette
footnote:[VR prototyping tool, allowing fast building of spatial environments https://maquette.ms]
and for interactions with various items inside the 3D worlds, Unity's
XR Interaction Toolkit library was used. This library allows users to
intuitively pick items with their hands and iteract with them (e.g. throw them
or put somewhere).

Created models are very basic and overall there wasn't much focus on design
of the models or making the scene photorealistic. Because of the limited time,
the scene design is functional and simplistic, not beautiful.

By making this example application, the OpenHVR system was validated and proved, that
it can be used as a whole and works for desired purpose. Application is using
all parts of the system -- the server must be running, the devices must be
connected and tracked their positions. Application is producing effects
using those devices, so the Unity plug-in must be used to produce the effects.

=== Testing entities

The example application could be used for user testing. For those purposes,
two main testing entities are included within the scene of the application.

==== Windows

There are multiple breakable windows in the room. Each of the interactable
window can be set to produce various combinations of effects. Any combination
of following effects can be turned on or off, according to testing
scenario requirements:

* Visual effect of blowing wind
* Sound effect of blowing wind
* Blue cold screen colorization to indicate changing temperature
* OpenHVR wind effect at the location of the window

The room also contains interactable pieces of stones. Users can grab those
stones and throw them at the windows to break them. After breaking the window,
the effects will run.

==== Fireplaces

The virtual room will have multiple fireplaces. Users can grab a match and
start a fire. When fire is started, similarily to the windows, an optional
combination of effects will start:

* Visual effect of fire
* Sound effect of fire and cracking wood
* Orange warm screen colorization to indicate the change of temperature
* OpenHVR heat effect at the location of the fireplace
