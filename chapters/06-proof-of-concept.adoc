== Proof of Concept results

In April 2019, a proof of concept was performed as a coursework for the MI-MPR
course at FIT CTU<<poc>>. During the course a testing hardware was assembled
and simple Unity script was implemented.

The work shortly discussed the motivation and inspiration for the idea,
specified some goals and presented a simple use-case of the system. In one of the
chapters it defined some expected results and projected a work schedule.
Opportunities for various experiments were proposed.

Lastly, the implementation and its results were described. The implementation
focused solely on the wind simulation, as it's the easiest and most affordable
effect to simulate and test.

Some of the expected problems or experiment opportunities included, for example,
a need for taking in consideration the actuation time of the devices producing
the effects, or possibility of unability to reach desired quality of effect
simulation, caused, for example, by having not enough fans around the user
in the room, to simulate all kinds and directions of the wind.

The hardware consisted of two 3D-printed fan bodies, two DC toy motors and Arduino
UNO controlling the fans using PWM footnote:[Pulse Width Modulation]. Inside
the VR world, a red dot represented a wind source. Fan positions were manually
input. Unity plugin was constantly sending relative positions between the
wind source and fan positions to the Arduino board.

For simplicity, the VR application was not room-scaled, but in the
user sitting/standing mode, and worked only with 2-dimensional plane for
computing the direction differences between sources and effect producers.

The work successfully proved that such system can be created and layed down
the foundations for transforming the idea into master thesis project.
