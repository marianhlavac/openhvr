== Virtual Reality

There are many definitions describing the term Virtual Reality (shortly VR).
Some of them are older, and define virtual reality as following:

> Virtual Reality is electronic simulation of environments experienced via
head mounted eye goggles and wired clothing enabling the end user to interact
in realistic three-dimensional situations (Coates, 1992)

Other, newer ones, define VR as:

> The use of computer technology to create an interactive three-dimensional
world in which the objects have a sense of spatial presence;
virtual environment, and virtual world are synonyms for virtual reality.
(Department of Defense, 2018)

The age of the first definition is apparent, but whether using older or newer
definition, majority of them define VR as some kind of
virtual world that can be viewed, explored or experienced by the user.

Virtual Reality is sometimes mistakenly confused with Augmented Reality (AR).
For unenlightened people, these terms (VR and AR) can be hard to distinguish,
not to mention there are other terms in the industry, such as MR and XR
(mixed reality and extended reality, respectively). There is very simple
way to distinguish VR from AR -- VR is known to "replace" elements
(visual, sound) to provide full immersion in a completely different virtual
world, whereas AR often "adds" elements to the real world <<vrar>>.
The most clear example would be to compare HTC Vive VR headset with
Microsoft HoloLens AR headset -- Vive blocks your view completely, putting
a screen in front of your eyes, and HoloLens is equipped with holographic display,
which is transparent and allows you to see through.

It is also important to acknowledge, that Virtual Reality didn't always mean
putting a headset on your head and a controllers in your heads, as most of the
users of contemporary hardware would expect. Especially in
early VR experiments, the visuals could be provided by projecting the images
on four walls surrounding the user (as in popular CAVE system <<cave>>) and
using surround sound system for the spatial audio.

=== Contemporary hardware

The days of low-resolution, high-latency displays and expensive, unavailable and
unprecise hardware sensors are long gone. Nowadays, virtual reality headsets are
sold as a consumer product and are available to almost everyone. They are
equipped with high-frequency refresh-rate displays, fast and low-latency
gyroscopes and other high-end electronics components invented in the last
decades.

Current consumer virtual reality headsets features, among other components,
a high resolution displays with refresh speeds often reaching 90Hz, gyroscopes
with up to 0.01Â° rotation precision and stereo headphones with 3D sound.
Location tracking of the VR system can reach up to sub-millimetric precision
<<vivenasa>> and motion-to-photon latency
footnote:[Latency measured between headset motion and photons emitted from the display.]
on some headsets range between 2-7 milliseconds. <<mtpltc>> <<xinwiki>>
VR headsets offers such precise tracking abilities, that it's suitable even
for researching purposes and scientific projects <<vivepbsr>>, and therefore
it shouldn't be surprising that VR is a very popular topic to research.

=== Uses of Virtual Reality

Looking closely at the investments made to AR and VR technologies, it suggests,
that the most popular application of AR/VR lies in entertainment industry, followed
by training situations, industrial maintenance and retail showcasing.
<<statistavr>>

Advancements in haptic feedback allows for better surgery training using
VR simulations <<vhfcrmisvrt>>. Though no exact data proving performance gains
weren't published yet, it can be expected that thanks to the correct haptic
feedback, VR training might become superior, compared to traditional
training methods. <<vrsrgr>>

=== Developing for Virtual Reality

The contemporary state of Virtual Reality development tools is undoubtfully
coupled to the videogame industry, together with the procedures and practices.
It shouldn't be surprising, that the most popular tools for creating
applications for virtual reality are game engines and frameworks.

The current most notable popular game engines, with the support of creating VR
applications are: Unity footnote:[https://unity3d.com] by
Unity Technologies, Unreal Engine footnote:[https://unrealengine.com] by
Epic Games, or Godot Engine, open-source engine developed by the community
under the MIT license. footnote:[https://godotengine.org] <<slantvr>>
