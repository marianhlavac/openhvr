After a practical experience with the Beego framework, it cannot be said that
it was the best choice. The framework’s design isn’t ideal and it seems, that
overall the quality is low (for example there are severe spelling mistakes in
error messages). Compared to other frameworks, the ORM funcionalities are very
limited and was barely suitable for such simple application. Lots of
functionalities was not working, even though documentation claims it should
work. For example, the relationships between tables are broken and sometimes
crashes the server, so they couldn’t be used. It took a big chunk of time
to troubleshoot and debug such situations. Sadly, the framework didn’t make
the development that much easy and comfortable as anticipated.
