== Designing the System

A name "OpenHVR" was chosen as a codename and project name, under which
all source codes will be publicly available. This name will be also further
mentioned in the text, carrying meaning of the actual system, that results from
this work.

=== Components cooperation

Following simple diagram is picturing the system components and the
communication between them.

<1> Administrator is user that configures the system and performs the
first set-up.
<2> VR User is user experiencing VR application. This user can (and often will
be) the same user as the Administrator.
<3> Configurator Tool (as described in chapter <<cfganl,5.4>>).
<4> VR Application written in Unity Engine (or possibly later other supported
frameworks and game engines), that is using OpenHVR Unity Plug-in
<5> Unity plug-in (as described in chapter <<unityanl,5.6>>).
<6> Effect Devices registered in setup instance of OpenHVR System.
<7> OpenHVR Communication Server (as described in chapter <<serveranl,5.5>>).

=== Configurator Tool wireframe prototype

As as first step of designing the Configurator Tool, a wireframe prototype
has been designed. Configurator Tool user interface will consist of only
two interactive screens -- the main screen and screen for creating new device.
On the main screen, user will be able to see overview of the room configuration,
manage (move, update, remove) effect devices and will see the status of the
system. The new device screen will be displayed after clicking on "new device"
button at the main screen.

The prototype pictures layout of the user interface.

=== REST API Design

Following is a list of resources available at the API endpoint, with short
descriptions is a simple draft of functions provided by the server
component and is a part of pre-implementation design.
Precise resource and schemas documentation, which is derived
directly from the implementation can be later found
in xref:./13-developer-guide.adoc#server-api[Chapter 13.1] of the
Developer Guide chapter.

GET /devices/::
Returns a list of registered effect devices in the current room configuration,
together with their properties (such as location, etc.).

POST /devices/::
Registers a new effect device in the room.

GET /devices/drivers::
Returns a list of currently available drivers. New drivers can be added only
by extending the source code of the server.

GET /devices/{deviceId}::
Returns details about a specific device.

PUT /devices/{deviceId}::
Updates specific device properties (such as its location, name description, etc.)

DELETE /devices/{deviceId}::
Removes registration of the device from the room configuration.

POST /effects/::
Requests new effect performance. This resource is meant to be requested by the
client each time there is an event happening in the VR scene, that should also
produce acompanying effect in the room. Using parameters from client
(location, type of effect, strength, duration, etc.), the server will calculate
which effect devices needs to be instructed and send the instructions to them.

DELETE /effects/::
Immediately cancels all previously requested effect performances. Useful when
scene needs to be cleared or for any reason it needs to be reassured that
no devices are producing any effects (for example when quitting the VR
application).

DELETE /effects/{effectId}::
Immediately cancels a specific, previously requested effect performance.
Cancelling specific performances is needed only when infinite duration
was specified when requesting. Otherwise the effect will end after the
duration and there is no need to cancel it.

GET /effects/types::
Returns list of available types of effects. Client applications can request
this list at their startup and raise a warning at the client-side, if VR
application is requesting effect that is not available.

GET /system/status::
Returns system status.

=== API Security

The server will not support authentication and all resources will be publicly
available. It is expected, that each server will serve single instance of
virtual reality setup and will be run on local network without public access.
Should user ever be concerned about unwanted access to the system, the server
will support IP whitelisting
footnote:[IP Whitelisting is common name for the process of filtering
requests by the sender IP address and letting through only the requests
of the set of IP address, that are specified on the "whitelist".].

Securing of each of the device depends on the software and firmware provided
with the smart device itself. Drivers included in the OpenHVR server should
support secure connection too. Tasmota firmware supports username and
password authentication.
