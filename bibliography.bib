We present a model-based performance testing approach that allows a fast simulation of specific usage scenarios in order to perform a quantitative analysis of the latency. Out of automatically generated log-data, we learn the distributions of latencies and apply statistical model checking to analyse the functional and timing behaviour. The result is a novel testing and verification technique for analysing the performance of IoT protocols. Two well-known open source MQTT implementations are evaluated and compared.",
